# The Agile Monkeys Challenge - The CRM Service
The CRM service is an API for customers' management.

## Architecture
* The CRM service is a RESTFul API that implements a CQRS architecture pattern to separate concerns from business logic.
* Command and mediator patterns were implemented to make easy unit tests.
* Persistence data layer uses Entity Framework Core.

## Requirements
- [x] Endpoints to managment users
- [x] Endpoints to managment Customers
- [X] Attach an image to Customer
- [X] Set/Remove admin role to User
- [x] Validate endpoints with Authorization & Authentication
- [x] Prevent SQL Injection
- [X] Prevent XSS

### Extra Requirements
- [X] Unit test
- [X] OAuth
- [ ] Continuous Deployment
- [ ] Docker/Vagrant or similar

### Notes
* **Pagination** was added to list customer information.
* **Automatic audit** was implemented to add reference to who updated it.
* **Soft delete** was implemented to avoid a real delete from database.
* **Swagger** was added.
* **AspNetCore Identity** was added.
* OAuth and Json Web Token was implemented using **Identity Server 4**.
